the computer doesnt understand any "language" by natural way

all languages go through a "compiler" that turns the code into 0/1 that the computer understands

----
heirarchy:




general purpose language (c, rust, c++)
assembly code (not compiled, its assembled actually)
machine language (0/1)
hardware


---- lower level languages:

c is the lowest level gen purpose language 

c++ is basically c with OOP added into it
    no garbage collection (memory management)

rust 
    newer language, similar to c++ 
    game engines/etc
    rocket framework for web applications
    getting very good at web assembly (a faster alternative to javascript)

pascal: 



---- compiled vs interpreted

compiled: 
    uses a compiler 
    compiled code is executed by CPU 
    more control of hardware rescources 
    very fast at runtime


interpreted (scripting): 
    uses garbage collection 
    uses an interpreter
    turns into "bytecode" 
    easier to work with usually


---- higher level languages 

    java
        everything you create is an object,
        write once run anywhere because JVM eliminates the need for recompiling 



---- statically typed 
    typechecking is done at compiling time

---- dynamically typed 
    do not need types to be defined specifically 

---- kotlin
    uses the JVM to make android apps.. 
    can be OOP or procedural 

---- c#
    statically typed, 
    OOP (like java)
    can use .net framework
    compiled 
    used for desktop applications, etc, web development (asp.net), gaming (unity), xamiran (mobile)

---- go 
    compiled, statically typed
    very fast and scalable, 
    
---- python
    dynamic, interepreted (scripting) language
    django (web framework)

---- ruby 
    similar to python, easy to learn 
    (web framework) ruby on rails 

---- javascript 
    largest widely used language on the web browser
    front end frameworks like react
    node.js for web development 
    electron uses javascript for desktop applications 

---- php
    dynamic scripting language
