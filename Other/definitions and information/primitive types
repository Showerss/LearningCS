Primitive Types
	Basically they are built in data types to that language, (char, int, bool, double, etc.)
	These are the most common primitive data type
	
	But overall primitive types are any sort of value that cannot go into anything more simple
	LISP is a language that has primitive types called atom and list which cant be broken down any more 
	
	Pointer, array, function, etc are NOT primitive data types BEUCASE they can be broken down more simply
