Mylist = []
Mylist.append to add to a list
Mylist.remove to remove from a list

Mylist = ["s", "o", "n"] + 4 wont add to a list, as only other lists can be added to a list using the + operator 

use -1 to select the last item of a list

calling something outside of a list returns an index error


can use mylist[1][0] to access the 2nd values first value in cases such as...
    mylist = [["ellie", 100], ["phillip", 101]]
    would return "phillip"


you can remove things from 3rd on list or whatnot if you do...
    mylist[1].remove("phillip")
    remove only removes the first instance of that word in a list, not all instances of the match


mylist.pop(2)
    .pop removes an element from a list as well at index locations, this index location is 2
    pop only takes integers, not strings


len()

using [:-2] would take everything but the last 2 elements from a list slice
using [-3:] would print everything but the first 3 elements
