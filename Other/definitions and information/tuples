a tuple is a data structure that can store multiple pieces of data, similar to a list
    big difference is that immutable, means that once its made it cannot be changed

my_info = ("Phillip", 29, "Progrmmer")

changing it gives a typeerror, meaning that a tuple cannot be redone


tuple = tuple = (1, 2, 3)
list = list = [1,2,3]

one_element_tuple = (4,)
