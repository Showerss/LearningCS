----
var.count("param") counts within that variable the number of times "param" is said



----
var.sort("param") sorts things within that var based on some parameter, or just blank for standard sorting
    (reverse=True) can be used to sort things backwards 
    .sort does not need an = to assign to anything.. .sort works alone just fine

----
sorted(ListNAme) generates an entirely new list instead of modifying the way .sort() does.. 
    also sorted() comes first
    = newlistname = sorted(listname) 



insert()
pop()
range()
len()
